            <h2 class="subtitle1" id="subtitle1">What is mental health?</h2>
            <p class="part1" id="part1">
                Mental health refers to our state of mind, which includes our emotional, psychological<br>
                and social wellbeing. It affects how we think, feel and act, it also affects how we deal<br>
                with stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important in<br>
                every stage of life whether you are a child or an adult. Mental health can change overtime<br>
                depending on many different factors. Putting more work/life pressure on someone <br>
                then they can handle can negatively impact their mental health. For example if a person<br>
                is caring for a very sick relative, or have too much work piled on them, their mental <br>
                health can decline.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle2" id="subtitle2"> Is mental health important for overall health?</h2>
            <p class="part2" id="part2">
                Yes, but physical health is as important for overall health. If somebody has a mental <br>
                health illness such as depression, their risks or getting chronic illness such as <br>
                diabetes increases possibly due to the way they cope with the mental illness. Similarly,<br>
                if someone has a chronic illness such as diabetes, being constantly worried about it <br>
                can also deteriorate their mental health.
            </p>
